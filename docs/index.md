## 🤖 100% AI-Generated Code

**This entire project was built using Vibe Coding through Claude Code, without any manual code editing by humans.** Every line of code, configuration, and even the documentation was generated through natural language conversations with AI.

**UI Design & Collaboration**: The user interface design and layout adjustments were crafted through collaborative sessions with **Google Stitch**, showcasing how different AI tools can work together to create cohesive, well-designed applications.

DevWorkbench is a **Totally Vibed Application** - conceived, designed, and implemented entirely through AI collaboration.
